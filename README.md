# SnakeBAC2018
Kamil Marut
Snake was made using Python and Pygame. It is for a final exam that i will have at the end of my high school year in France.
I used non-copyright music and the models were made by me in gimp.

I used Github as a directory that is easily accessible by people on the internet. Whenever I needed help, sharing my project with someone was made trough github.


Setup:
In order to run the game, download all the game folder. Then, you will need to install the modules that are needed to run the game. to do this, you will need to download requirements.txt and type this command in the command prompt : "pip install -r requirements.txt"

If you want to help me improve the game, feel free to suggest new things as you can create new pulls and share them with me.

My project's progress : 

First, the game looked like this. But that was before I used another mechanic of making the snake be a snake.
