# SnakeBAC2018
Kamil Marut
Snake was made using Python and Pygame. It is for a final exam that i will have at the end of my high school year in France.
I used non-copyright music and the models were made by me in gimp.

I don't know much about licences and I don't realy want to search for this and use one to protect this. The game is made as a project that will count in my final exam. I thrust people and hope that the game will not spread until I have my grades arround two months after the 20 may. I hope you understand that and will not post my game before this date. Thanks



Setup:
You will need to download all the files and put them in a folder.
For the game to work, you will need to download and install the module needed. The modules needed are in requirement.txt.
install them using this command : "pip install -r requirements.txt"

If you want to help me improve the game, feel free to suggest new things..
